# Asynchronous Jobs {#asynchronous-jobs}

To reduce adverse impact on performance, [!DNL Adobe Experience Manger Assets] processes certain long-running and resource-intensive asset operations asynchronously. Asynchronous processing involves enqueuing multiple tasks and eventually executing them in a serial manner subject to the availability of system resources.

For further details, please see the document [Asynchronous Jobs](/help/sites-administering/asynchronous-jobs.md) in the Administration user guide.
