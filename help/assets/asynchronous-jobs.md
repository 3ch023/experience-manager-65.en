# Asynchronous operations {#asynchronous-operations}

To reduce adverse impact on performance, Adobe Experience Manger Assets processes certain long-running and resource-intensive asset operations asynchronously.

For further details, please see the document [Asynchronous Operations](/help/sites-administering/asynchronous-jobs.md) in the Administration user guide.
