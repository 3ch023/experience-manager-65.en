# Private folder in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] {#private-folder}

You can create a private folder in the [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] user interface that is available exclusively to you. You can share this private folder to other users and assign various privileges to them. Based on the privilege level you assign, users can perform various tasks on the folder, for example view assets within the folder or edit the assets.

   >[!NOTE]

   >You can assign various roles, such as Editor, Owner, or Viewer to the user with whom you share the folder. If you assign an Owner role to the user, the user has Editors privileges on the folder. In addition, the user can share the folder with others. If you assign an Editor role, the user can edit the assets in your private folder. If you assign a viewer role, the user can only view the assets in your private folder.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Private folder has at least one member with Owner role. Therefore, administrator cannot remove all the owner members from a private folder. However, to remove existing owners (and administrator itself) from the private folder the administrator must add another user as owner.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. Depending on the role you assign, the user is assigned a set of privileges on your private folder when the user logs in to [!DNL Assets].
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Ok]** to close the confirmation message.
1. The user with whom you share the folder receives a sharing notification. Log in to [!DNL Assets] with the credentials of the user to view the notification.

>[!NOTE]

>To create a private folder, you require Read and Edit ACL permissions on the parent folder under which you want to create a private folder. If you are not an administrator, these permissions are not enabled for you by default on `/content/dam`. In this case, first obtain these permissions for your user ID/group before attempting to create private folders or view folder settings.

## Private folder deletion {#delete-private-folder}

You can delete a private folder by selecting the folder and selecting [!UICONTROL Delete] option from the top menu, or by using Backspace key on your keyboard.

### User group removal on folder deletion {#group-removal-on-folder-deletion}

If you delete a private folder using the above method from the user interface, then the associated user groups are also deleted. However, existing redundant, unused, and autogenerated user groups can be cleaned up from the repository using [JMX](#group-clean-up-jmx).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you delete a private folder from CRXDE Lite, then redundant user groups are left in the repository.

### Use JMX to clean-up unused user groups {#group-clean-up-jmx}

To clean up repository of unused user groups:

1. Open the JMX to clean redundant groups for Assets from `http://[server]:[port]/system/console/jmx/com.day.cq.dam.core.impl.team%3Atype%3DClean+redundant+groups+for+Assets`.

1. Invoke the `clean` method from this JMX.

You can see that all the redundant user groups or the autogenerated groups (that get created on creating a private folder with the name same as a previously deleted group) are removed from the path `/home/groups/mac/default/<user_name>/<folder_name>`.
