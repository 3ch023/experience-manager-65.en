# Get Asset Insights using [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] {#}

Marketers and content creators can quickly get analytics numbers about consumption and usage of their assets using Asset Insights functionality of Adobe Experience Manager Assets. It helps them gauge the returns on the marketing effort and measure KPIs. The reports are self-service from within Experience Manager user interface and do not rely on other vendors or IT departments to work.

Using the insights, you can validate efforts and spend on marketing programs, reuse better performing assets, get to know and improve the assets that do not perform as well as expected, and much more.

Asset Insights uses Adobe Launch to collect and process the analytics data.

>Previously, Assets used [Adobe DTM for insights](/help/assets/touch-ui-using-dtm-for-asset-insights.md) functionality which is shortly being discontinued.
