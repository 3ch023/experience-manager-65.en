# Searching Video Assets {#searching-video-assets}

To save time and effort from having to browse through potentially hundreds of videos, use keywords, file properties such as a file's type, or recently modified time stamp to quickly find your file.

If you aren't seeing the file you are looking for, you can change the entire scope of a search by clicking one of the options at the bottom of the search results. For example, if you search for a file in the Documents library but you cannot find it, you can click Libraries to expand the search to the rest of your libraries. For more information, see [Find a file or folder](https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-a-file-or-folder).

You can search for digital assets based on one or more of the following properties:

<table> 
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Search field</strong></td> 
   <td><strong>Search property values</strong></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p>Mime Types</p> </td>

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Experience Manager]** page, in the left rail, tap **[!UICONTROL Assets]**.

   If the left rail is not visible, tap the Toggle Rail icon (the lines in the icon will either be dark grey or blue).

1. Open the folder that makes the most sense as a starting point for your search.
1. On the toolbar, tap the Search icon (magnifying glass).
1. Search for video assets by doing any one of the following:

    * Search using keywords  

      In the Enter Keywords field, start typing and then press Enter.  

      The current view is filtered based on the keywords that you type. Files are displayed as search results if your keywords match the file's name, metadata tags, or other properties.
  
    * Search using properties  

      To search for a video file based on a property such as the video's type, you can narrow the search by selecting a video or audio property. For example, expand the Video Format drop-down, and then check one or more values. Some properties require you to enter a minimum and maximum value. 
  
    * Search using keywords and properties  

      Enter a keyword but instead of pressing Enter, expand a video or audio property list, and then set the values you want.

1. (Optional) Near the bottom of the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Save Smart Collection]**, enter a name for the search. Check **[!UICONTROL Public]** if you want the saved search made available to other users of the Adobe Experience Manager account. Uncheck if you want the search made available only to you when you are signed in to the account. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
