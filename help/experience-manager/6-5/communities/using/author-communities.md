# Communities Components{#communities-components}

## Introduction {#introduction}

When AEM Communities is licensed, in addition to creating community sites, it is possible to add Communities features to any AEM site using standard AEM authoring tools.

To learn more about creating a community site visit :

* [AEM Communities Overview](../../../6-5/communities/using/overview.md)
* [Getting Started with AEM Communities](../../../6-5/communities/using/getting-started.md)
* [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](/6-5/communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md)

>[!NOTE]

>If not familiar with the authoring environment, view the documentation on [basic handling](../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/basic-handling.md) and a [quick guide to authoring pages](../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/qg-page-authoring.md).

## Available Communities Components {#available-communities-components}

The following table lists the Communities components visible to authors when enabled in the components browser (sidekick).
