# Introduction to Customizing AEM form workspace{#introduction-to-customizing-aem-form-workspace}

AEM form workspace provides capabilities to modify the presentation semantics and functionality of its interface. The types of customizations to change the style, layout, formatting, branding, and core functionality are described below.

An example of a customized workspace

## Types of customizations {#types-of-customizations}

AEM Forms workspace supports a wide variety of customizations to update the layout of the user interface, its appearance, functionality, and much more. The customizations involve updating one or more of the following:

* Appearances of the user interface
* Functionality using semantic customizations  
* Reusing HTML components in other applications

### User interface changes {#user-interface-changes}

You can change the appearance, layout, and other presentation semantics of AEM Forms workspace. Change workspace by customizing the CSS, HTML templates, and JavaScriptâ„¢ files. All the default files are provided in the default installation.

The most commonly applicable steps are covered in [Generic steps for AEM Forms workspace customization](../../../6-5/forms/using/generic-steps-html-workspace-customization.md). For specific examples of such customizations, including the detailed steps, see the related articles at the end of this article.

#### Understanding the style sheet {#understanding-the-style-sheet}

Before customizing workspace, make yourself familiar with the default style sheet supplied with AEM Forms at /libs/ws/css/style.css.

To customize the workspace, it is recommended that you make yourself familiar with the existing style sheet, style.css, located in /libs/ws/css folder. A few prominent components are described below.

#### CSS {#css}

The appearance of AEM Forms workspace borrows its appearance from a CSS. By customizing the CSS, you can change the presentation semantics of workspace like fonts, colors, branding, and layout.

The top-level steps for CSS customization are:

* Create a CSS file.  
* Add style items to this CSS. See Understanding CSS Styles for more information.
* Update its references in `html.jsp`.

For the exact steps to do these customizations, see [Generic steps for AEM Forms workspace customization](../../../6-5/forms/using/generic-steps-html-workspace-customization.md). The CSS file shipped with AEM Forms workspace is at /libs/ws/css/. For CSS-related customizations, use the [Ship Package](../../../6-5/forms/using/introduction-customizing-html-workspace.md#p-crx-package-p). For specific examples of CSS-related customizations, see the related Help topics at the end of this article.

#### Image {#image}

You can customize the AEM Forms workspace to add avatars of users or to add the logo of your organization. For these customizations, use [Ship Package](../../../6-5/forms/using/introduction-customizing-html-workspace.md#p-crx-package-p).

The top-level steps for customizations to the images are:

* Install and configure WebDAV.
* Add new images.
* Add new styles corresponding to the added images.
* Link to the new CSS file in `html.jsp` file.

To get started with customizing the images in AEM Forms workspace, follow the [Generic steps for AEM Forms workspace customization](../../../6-5/forms/using/generic-steps-html-workspace-customization.md). For specific examples of image-related customizations, see the related Help topics at the end of this article.

#### HTML template {#html-template}

HTML templates help define the appearance and the layout of the workspace user interface. By updating the default HTML templates you can customize the layout default user interface.

The top-level steps for customizations to the HTML template are:

* In a user-created folder, make copies of the required default files.
* Add new templates in user-defined folder.
* Make relevant updates to the copied files like, the path of the new template.

For specific examples of such customizations, see the Help topics provided at the end of this article. Choose between the [Ship Package](../../../6-5/forms/using/introduction-customizing-html-workspace.md#p-crx-package-p) or the [Dev Package](../../../6-5/forms/using/introduction-customizing-html-workspace.md#p-crx-package-p), depending on the template to be customized.

### Semantic changes {#semantic-changes}

To modify the AEM Forms workspace functionality, change the JavaScript source code. Modifications in the core functionality are labeled as Semantic changes. You modify models, view, and templates provided as part of the source code of AEM Forms workspace.

The top-level steps to do semantic changes to modify the functionality of AEM Forms workspace are:

* In a user-created folder, make copies of the appropriate default files.
* Add new models and views in the user-defined folder.
* Make relevant updates like updating paths of newly added models and views in the default JavaScript files.
* Minify the package to optimize the performance.

For more conceptual information about the components that are part of the source code, see the [Description of reusable components](/6-5/forms/using/description-reusable-components.md). For these customizations, use the Dev Package.

### Reusable components {#reusable-components}

As AEM Forms workspace is a component-based software, it can be easily customized and reused. You can easily integrate the workspace components with your web applications.

For more conceptual information, see the [Description of reusable components](/6-5/forms/using/description-reusable-components.md) and for instruction about using the components, see [Integrating AEM Forms workspace components in web applications](/6-5/forms/using/description-reusable-components.md).

### CRX Package {#crx-package}

CRX package can be deployed on the CRXâ„¢ repository. It is available at `[*LC root*]\crx-repository\install\adobe-lc-workspace-pkg.zip`.

This package can be built using the three profiles described below.

| **Profile ** |**Description ** |**Usage ** |
|---|---|---|
| Ship profile |This profile creates a CRX package of the smallest possible size using minification. This package is the most efficient. All the JavaScriptâ„¢ files are combined and minified into a single JS file. |Use this profile when no further semantic changes are required in JS files. |
| Debug profile |This profile creates a moderately efficient CRX package. The size of the package is slightly more than the package created using Ship profile. This package has most of the JavaScript files combined into a single JS file. |Use this profile for debugging. |
| Dev profile |This profile creates a CRX package of the largest possible size. All the JavaScript files are available separately, as they are in SDK package. |Use this profile when incorporating semantic changes. |
