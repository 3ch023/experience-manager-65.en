   >By default, there is only one translation setting. To be able to select other settings, you have to configure cloud configurations first. See [Configuring the Translation Integration Framework](/6-5/sites/administering/using/tc-tic.md).

1. The **Next **button brings you to the **Translate** step of the wizard. Here you can choose between creating the structure only, creating a new translation project or adding to an existing translation project.

   >If you selected multiple languages in the previous step, multiple translation projects will be created.
