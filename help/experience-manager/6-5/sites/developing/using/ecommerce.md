# eCommerce{#ecommerce}

The integration framework includes an integration layer with an API. This allows you to:

* plug in an eCommerce system and pull product data into AEM
* build AEM components for commerce capabilities independent of the specific eCommerce engine

For more information, see:

* [Developing (generic)](/6-5/sites/developing/using/generic.md)
* [Developing with SAP Commerce Cloud](../../../../6-5/sites/developing/using/hybris.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Since the eCommerce framework can be used with any eCommerce solution, see [Developing (generic)](/6-5/sites/developing/using/generic.md) for more information about developing possibilities.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To use the integration framework with external eCommerce providers, you first need to install the required packages. For more information, see [Deploying eCommerce](../../../../6-5/sites/deploying/using/ecommerce.md).
