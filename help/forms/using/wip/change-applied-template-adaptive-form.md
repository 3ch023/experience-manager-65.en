Changing an adaptive formâ€™s template updates the appearances, the layout, and the design of the form. A change in the template does not impact the form data or the information present in the form.

1. Select an adaptive form and click Edit Template ![](assets/aem6forms_tableedit.png) in the toolbar.
1. On the Edit Template Wizard, select the new template. To search for the applicable template, use the search box and select from the search results.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can use text strings or strings with wildcards to search for available templates. To know more, see [Searching for forms and assets](../../../forms/using/searching-forms-or-assets.md). The template search behaves similar to the asset search.

   Edit Template Wizard

1. After selecting the applicable template, click Update in upper right corner. If the change is successful, a success message is displayed. Optionally, you can open the adaptive form with newly applied template from this dialog.

The following form properties are updated with new values, when a new template is applied to an adaptive form:

* `cq:designPath`
* `sling:resourceSuperType`
* `sling:resourceType`
* `cq:template`
