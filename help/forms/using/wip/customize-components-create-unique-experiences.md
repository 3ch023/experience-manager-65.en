# DO NOT PUBLISH Customize components to create unique data capturing experiences {#do-not-publish-customize-components-to-create-unique-data-capturing-experiences}

## Overview {#overview}

AEM Forms are primarily used to capture data from the users. Users fill forms, and authors collect information from them. With advancement in HTML5, you can create user friendly and intuitive information gathering experiences. Sometimes, you customize components available in AEM Forms to create a specific user interaction experience.

With AEM Forms, you can customize appearance of components easily to enhance the experience when users fill your forms and provide information. Apart from customizing appearance of the components, more data capturing experiences are available to you that use customization of out-of-the-box components. The data capturing experiences included with AEM Forms are:

* **Date Input Field** 
  Use Date Input Field component in your form, to let fill day, month, and year separately in three boxes. You can customize the look and feel of the component, and change the date format. For example, you can let your customers input dates in `MM/DD/YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY` format.  

* **Image Choice**
Use Image Choice component in your form to let your customers select an image to provide information. You can use the information to provide personalized services to your customers. For example, your customer is interested in purchasing a car from your store. You ask your customer to fill an online form. In your form, you provide four different images of the car. Each image shows the car with a different color, and your customer selects the image with the preferred color.  

* **Numeric Stepper**
Use Numeric Stepper in your form to let your customers input a numeric value, which they can increase or decrease based on a predefined step. For example, your form lets users book movie tickets. Users provide the number of people going to watch a movie. You can use the Numeric Stepper component with step value as 1. So the user can enter the number of people and increase the value. For example, user enters 2. User can increase the value to 3, 4, or 5, incrementing the number based on the step. Similarly, you can change the step value. Instead of 1, you can use 5. If a user enters 2 as the number of people, the user can increase the number of people to 7, 12, or 17. 
* **AEM Form** 
  Use AEM Form component add an adaptive form within your form.
