# DO NOT PUBLISH - Project guide for developing adaptive forms{#do-not-publish-project-guide-for-developing-adaptive-forms}

A document overview that answers:

* what is this document about?
* who should read it?
* what should I know before reading it?
* what next?

## Plan {#plan}

In the planning phase, you will:

* define business goals
* identify use case requirements
* determine technologies to implement the project
* identify personas and required skills to build a team

### Define business goals {#define-business-goals}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* define a vision for the project
* explain what you want to achieve with it
* defines KPIs to measure business goals

### Identify use cases {#identify-use-cases}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* identify the use cases requirements that meet your business goals
* document each use case in detail, get sign-off, and freeze the use case requirements 
* explore and define:

    * type and number of forms
    * business process workflows you need around forms
    * strategy to handle submitted form data, especially PII data
    * identify document generation requirements  
    * identify any special requirements for your use cases

### Determine existing infrastructure and required technologies {#determine-existing-infrastructure-and-required-technologies}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* assess your existing infrastructure
* determine technology and infrastructural requirements to fulfill use cases
* determine requirements for manage services
* determine answers to:

    * are you an existing LiveCycle, AEM Forms, or AEM Sites customer? 
    * are you migrating, upgrading, or starting afresh?
    * do you need Forms on OSGi or JEE to implement your use cases?
    * do you need any AEM component other than Forms?
    * what architecture and deployment do you choose?
    * what tools will you use to set up the development environment?
    * what is your back up and restore strategy?
    * how to configure the environment for optimal performance?
    * how to ensure security of the development environment?

### Build a project team {#build-a-project-team}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* identify the skills required to set up and excute the project
* define roles and responsibilities for:

    * System Administrator
    * AEM (Forms + Sites) Architect
    * Forms Author
    * Forms Developer

## Set up {#set-up}

Once you have identified all infrastructural and technical requirements in the planning phase, the next phase in the project is to set up the development environment.

### Set up the environment {#set-up-the-environment}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* install or upgrade forms
* integrate third-party systems with Forms
* set up the project and its structure
* set up author, publish, and processing instances
* set up development, stage, and production environment  
* migrate/import assets from previous infrastructure to the current environment
* configure and test external storage system for submitted forms data
* configure the environment for optimal performance
* secure the development and publishing environment
* Verify that the environment is properly set up

## Develop and test {#develop-and-test}

The development environment is ready. Now, you will:

* prepare the authoring and development environment for adaptive forms
* author and develop adaptive forms
* test adaptive forms

### Preparing authoring environment {#preparing-authoring-environment}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* migrate/import assets from existing infrastructure to the development environment
* set up cloud services like Adobe Sign, Analytics, Target and third-party services
* integrate data sources to create form data model
* Understand OOTB AF components, themes, and capabilities
* identify use cases and create custom templates
* identify use cases and create custom themes
* identify use cases and create custom components
* identify and create fragments for common elements across forms

### Author adaptive forms {#author-adaptive-forms}

At the end of this step, you will able to:

* understand various form data models and their pros and cons for creating adaptive forms
* leverage existing XDP, XML, and JSON schemas to create adaptive forms
* use templates to create coherent adaptive forms across organization
* use fragments to reuse content and ensure performance
* use themes for consistent styling of forms
* use adaptive form components to build forms
* create rules and scripts to implement business logic in forms
* use localization workflows to localize adaptive forms
* create forms workflows to implement business processes
* optimize performance of large forms with fragments, lazy-loading, capacity and performance planning

### Test adaptive forms {#test-adaptive-forms}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* understand what to test in adaptive forms
* identify areas for automated and manual tests
* perform automated and manual tests
* use developer tools like Chrome plugin and Hobbes test framework

## Go live {#go-live}

You have all the assets and environment ready, it is the time to go live.

### Prepare for rollout {#prepare-for-rollout}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* move assets from prod to stage to publish environment
* secure publishing environment
* configure publish server for optimal performance
* set up and configure forms portal
* publish forms

## Manage {#manage}

You are live and as you scale up, you need to maintain and manage your environment.

### Monitor and maintain the development environment {#monitor-and-maintain-the-development-environment}

At the end of this step, you will be able to:

* keep your system updated
* administer the environment, assets, and users
* monitor performance
* take measures to scale the environment
* debug errors
* work with Adobe support
