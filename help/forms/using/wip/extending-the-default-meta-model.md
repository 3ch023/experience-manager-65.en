# DO NOT PUBLISH Extending the default meta-model {#do-not-publish-extending-the-default-meta-model}

Automated Forms Conversion service identifies and extracts form objects from legacy forms. Meta-model helps the service to decide how the extracted objects are represented in an adaptive form. For example, a legacy form can have many different types of representations of a date and the meta-model helps map all the representations of date with date component of adaptive forms. Meta-model also allows the service to pre-configure validations, rules, data patterns, help text, and accessibility properties of adaptive form components.

Automated Forms Conversion service provides a default meta-model. The meta-model is a JSON schema. It defines mapping for all the adaptive form components. For example, a legacy form field with keyword phone, telephone, mobile phone, work phone, home phone, telephone number, telephone no, and phone number are mapped to the adaptive formâ€™s telephone component. You can extend the default the meta-model to add mapping and properties specific to your organization.
