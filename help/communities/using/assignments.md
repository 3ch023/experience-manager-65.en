# Assignments Feature{#assignments-feature}

The Enablement Assignments and [Enablement Catalog](/communities/using/catalog.md) components found in the Communities group in the components browser are components of an [enablement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#enablement-community).

The Enablement Assignments component allows the currently signed-in community member (learner) to access their assigned [enablement resources](/communities/using/resources.md).

From the [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](/communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md) tutorial, see a member's view of assignments and catalogs in the [Experience the Published Site](/communities/using/enablement-published-site.md) section.

### Additional Information {#additional-information}

For more information, see the [Assignments Essentials](../../communities/using/essentials-assignments.md) page for developers.

The [assignments function](../../communities/using/functions.md#assignments-function) is available while creating a [community site](../../communities/using/sites-console.md).
