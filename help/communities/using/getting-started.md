# Getting Started with AEM Communities{#getting-started-with-aem-communities}

AEM Communities allows companies to create dedicated branded community experiences from a library of site templates. Forums, groups, blogs, file sharing, calendars, activity feeds, and extended user profiles can be integrated into your website to foster interactions between propsects, customers, and companies.

Following is a tutorial on quickly setting up an [engagement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#engagement-community) for demonstration or development purposes.

For a tutorial on quickly setting up an [enablement community](../../communities/using/overview.md#enablement-community), visit [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](/communities/using/getting-started-enablement.md).
