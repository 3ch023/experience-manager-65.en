# Bulk Processing Operations{#bulk-processing-operations}

## Introduction {#introduction}

With the newewst version of AEM, the select all button has been extended to all views: List, Column and Card view. The select all button now selects all** **content in a given folder or collection and not just the Assets and Pages that are loaded and visible in the client browser.

Key actions have been enabled for the bulk operation: **Move**, **Delete** and **Copy**. A new dialog will let customers know what are the actuions that bulk processing is unavailable for.

## How To Use {#how-to-use}

A new button called **Select All** has been added to the Card, List or Column views. This button can be used in any of the views to select all the elements in the data set.

In previous versions of AEM, the selection was limited what was loaded in the client browser. This new changes has been introduced to avoid confusion regarding the number of elements a bulk operation is being performed on.

For now, three operations have been added to bulk processing:

* Move
* Copy
* Delete

Support for more operations will be added in the future.  
In order to use this feature, you need to navigate to the folder or collection where you want to perform bulk operation on Pages or on Assets.

Then, choose one of the views, as shown below:

### Card View {#card-view}

Assets or Pages can be selected in bulk using the **Select All** button on top right:

## Bulk enabled Operations {#bulk-enabled-operations}

After selection, one of the three bulk enabled actions can be performed: **Move**, **Copy** or **Delete**.

Here, **Move** operation is performed on the Assets selected above. In any of the views, this will result in all Assets being moved to the chosen location and not just the ones that are loaded on the screen.

For other operations that are not bulk enabled, like **Download,** a warning will be shown that only stating that only elements that are loaded in the browser will be included in the operation.
