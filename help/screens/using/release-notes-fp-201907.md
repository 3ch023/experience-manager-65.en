### What's New {#what-s-new}

* **Data Trigger drives AEM Screens channel change**

The player switches to a channel showing the emergency info upon receiving an event fired by the emergency system. The channel plays exclusively until the emergency situation is over.

Refer to [**Emergency Channel**](../../screens/using/emergency-channel.md) Use Case for implementation.

Additionally, refer to the use case example, ** [Data Triggered Asset Change](../../screens/using/data-triggered-asset-change.md)** that describes how to achieve personalized content based on weather of your location.

* **Targeting Enabled for asynchronous components (*such as videos, embedded sequence*)**

Targeting** **can now be enabled for assets used in AEM Screens project.

To learn more about how you can enable targeting for assets in AEM Screens project, refer to [**Configuring ContextHub in AEM Screens**](../../screens/using/configuring-context-hub.md).

After you have configured ContextHub for your AEM Screens project, follow different use cases to understand how data triggered assets plays a vital role in different industries:

** [Retail Inventory Targeted Activation](../../screens/using/retail-inventory-activation.md)**

** [Travel Center Temperature Activation](../../screens/using/local-temperature-activation.md)  
**

[**Hospitality Reservation Activation**](../../screens/using/hospitality-reservation-activation.md)

* **Improvements in Update Handlers**

The update handler now parses the experience fragments and collects any image, video or product associated to it.

* **Launches**

Launches allow content authors to create future version of the channel(s). With the help of launches, authors can preview each channel in the launch and should be able to initiate a request for review. Approvers group will get notification and can approve or reject the request. When the live date is reached, the content plays in the devices.
