# Display Layout Editor{#display-layout-editor}

***Zone Mapping*** allows you to create different zones and use variety of assets such as videos, images, and text that can be combined inn a single screen in contexual ways. You can pull in images, videos, and texts and allow it all to blend together and create an intuitive and interactive digital experience. As per the project requirements, sometimes you need multiple zones in a display.

For example, a product sequence with a related social media feed running in two separate zones on a single display.

## Overview {#overview}

While creating a display for your channel, you can choose different template options to view/manage content in your channel.

The following templates are available while creating zones for display:

* 2x1 
* 2x2 
* 3x1 
* 4x1
* 5x1

Using any one of these templates allows you to create an intuitive and interactive digital signage experience where a variety of content can be leveraged on a single screen.

>To learn in-depth about creating channels and displays, see [Managing Channels](managing-channels.md) and [Managing Displays](managing-displays.md) respectively in Authoring Screens.

## Use Case Description {#use-case-description}

This use case allows you to create an AEM Screens project with a channel that leverages content and display it on screen in multi zones.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Zones do not scale the content and that must be done prior to inserting the content to your channels.
