# Kickstart Guide{#kickstart-guide}

This section is a kickstart to AEM Screens and shows how to achieve basic actions. It walks you through setting up a basic digital signage experience with content/assets and publishing to a Screens player. For an in-depth understanding of all the components for Screens development, see the resources at the end of the page.

## Creating a Digital Signage Experience in 5 minutes {#creating-a-digital-signage-experience-in-minutes}

The following steps allow you to create a sample project for Screens and publish content to Screens player.

1. To download **AEM Screens Player**, click [here](https://download.macromedia.com/screens/).

   AEM Screens is also available in **Google Play**.

   For implementation of Chrome OS Player, see [Chrome Management Console](implementing-chrome-os-player.md) for more information.

   See [Installing and Configuring Screens](configuring-screens-introduction.md) for more details.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >**OSGI Settings**
   >
   >You need to enable the empty referrer to allow the device to post data to the server. For example, if the empty referrer property is disabled, the device cannot post a screenshot back. Currently some of these features are only available if the Apache Sling Referrer Filter Allow Empty is enabled in the OSGI Config. The dashboard may display a warning that security settings may prevent some of these features from working.
   >
   >Follow the steps below to enable the ***Apache Sling Referrer Filter Allow Empty***:
   >
   >1. Navigate to [Adobe Experience Manager Web Console Configuration](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.security.impl.ReferrerFilter).
   >1. Check the **allow.empty** option.
   >1. Click **Save**.
   >    
   >To learn more about the preceding steps in details, refer to the ***Prerequisites*** section in [Configuring and Deploying AEM Screens](configuring-screens-introduction.md).

1. **Creating a new project**

    1. Select the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left) and then **Screens**. Alternatively, you can ï»¿go directly to: [http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens](http://localhost:4502/screens.html/content/screens).
    1. Click **Create** to create a new Screens project (see the figure below).
    1. Select **Screens** from the **Create Screens Project** wizard and click **Next**.

   ![chlimage_1-64](assets/chlimage_1-64.png)

   Once the project is created, it brings you back to the Screens Project console. You can now select your project. In a project, there are five kind of folders namely **Schedules**, **Locations**, **Applications**, **Devices** and **Channels**, as shown in the figure below.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Schedules is only available if you have installed AEM 6.3 Sites Feature Pack 1. To get access to this Feature Pack, you must contact Adobe Support and request access. Once you have permissions you can download it from Package Share.

### Viewing the content in Screens Player {#viewing-the-content-in-screens-player}

Once you have added the above configurations, the player should automatically show the default channel for the display on your device, for example an image (in this scenario, a sequence channel and the content is visible in Screens Player for web browser).

![screen_shot_2019-03-04at95334am](assets/screen_shot_2019-03-04at95334am.png)
