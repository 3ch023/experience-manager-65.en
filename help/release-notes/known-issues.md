# Known Issues{#known-issues}

This page keeps a list of known issues from Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 that was released in April 2019.

[Contact support](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/experience-manager.html) if you need more information about the known issues.

An issue is reported where the CRX-Quickstart, and its contents, are deleted.

On each of these actions, please ensure that the property "*htmllibmanager.fileSystemOutputCacheLocation*" is never an empty string:

1. Calling "*/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.rebuild.html?invalidate=true*".  
2. Upgrading to AEM 6.5.   
3. Executing "lazy content migration" on AEM 6.5.

A [Knowledge Base](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/avoid-crx-quickstart-deletion-in-aem-6-5.html) article is available with further details and the workaround for this issue.

## Forms {#forms}

<!--
Comment Type: remark
Last Modified By: Vishal. Gupta (vishgupt)
Last Modified Date: 2019-04-04T08:45:41.038-0400
<p>Updated for AEM 6.5 Forms.</p>
-->

* When AEM Forms is installed on Linux oprating system, Digital Signature with Hardware Security Module do not work. (CQ-4266721)  
* (AEM Forms on WebSphere only) The **Forms Workflow **&gt; **Task Search** option does not return any result if you search for an **Administrator** with **Username** as the search criteria. (CQ-4266457)  

* AEM Forms fails to convert .tif and .tiff files with JPEG compression to PDF Documents. (CQ-4265972)
* The **AEM Forms Assets Scanner** and **Letter to Interactive Communication Migration** options do not work on the **AEM Forms Migration** page. (CQ-4266572)  

* (JBoss 7 only) When you upgrade from a previous version to AEM 6.5 Forms and the previous version had processes (.lca) that created and used a copy of the default submit or default render process, HTML5 Forms using such processes (.lca) fails to perform the required actions. (CQ-4243928)
* In an adaptive from, when a form data model service is invoked from the rule editor to dynamically update values of the image choice component, values of the image choice component are not updated. (CQ-4254754)  
* AEM Forms Designer installer requires the 32-bit version of [Visual C++ redistributable runtime package 2012](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and [Visual C++ redistributable runtime packages 2013](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/3179560/update-for-visual-c-2013-and-visual-c-redistributable-package). Ensure that the aforementioned redistributable runtime packages are installed before starting the installation. (CQ-4265668)

* When an adaptive form is configured to dynamically update values of a component and the publish instance that hosts the form is accessed through the dispatcher, the functionality to dynamically update values of a fields stop working. To resolve the issue, on the publish instance, open CRXDE, navigate to /libs/fd/af/runtime/clientlibs/guideChartReducer, and create the property listed in below.

    * Name: allowProxy
    * Type: Boolean
    * Value: true
    * Protected: False
    * Mandatory: False
    * Multiple: False
    * Auto Created: Flase

The property enables the client libraries under the runtime folder to access proxies. (CQ-4268679)
