## Install 6.5.2.0 {#install}

### Setup requirements {#setup-requirements}

* AEM 6.5.2.0 requires AEM 6.5. Check [upgrade documentation](../sites/deploying/using/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. 
* The Service Pack download is available on Adobe Package Share, which you can access directly from the AEM 6.5 instance.
* On a deployment with MongoDB and multiple instances, install AEM 6.5.2.0 on one of the Author instances using the Package Manager.
* Before installing the service pack, ensure to have a snapshot or fresh backup of your AEM instance. 
* Restart the instance before installation. While that is only needed when the instance is still in update mode (and this is the case when the instance was updated from an earlier version), it is recommended if the instance was running for longer period.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Adobe does not recommend removing or uninstalling the AEM 6.5.2.0 package.

### Install the Service Pack via Package Share {#install-the-service-pack-via-package-share}

Perform the following steps to install the Service Pack on an existing AEM 6.5 instance:

1. Login to Package Share within AEM or directly from your browser and download the [AEM 6.5.2.0 package](https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/marketplace/marketplaceProxy.html?packagePath=/content/companies/public/adobe/packages/cq650/servicepack/AEM-6.5.2.0).  
   (search for "AEM-6.5.2.0" to find it)  

1. Install the downloaded package using Package Manager.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Dialog on Package Manager UI sometimes exits immaturely during installation of 6.5.2.0**
>
>Therefore, it is recommended to wait for error logs to stabilize before accessing the instance. The user has to wait for specific logs related to uninstallation of updater bundle before being ensured that the installations is successful. It generally happens on Safari but can intermittently happen on any browser.

### Automatic installation {#automatic-installation}

There are two ways to automatically install AEM 6.5.2.0 into a running instance:

A. Place the package into ..*/crx-quickstart/install* folder while the server is running. The package gets installed automatically.

B. Use the [HTTP API from Package Manager](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/crx/2-3/how_to/package_manager.html) - make sure that you use cmd=install&recursive=true - so the nested packages  are  installed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>AEM 6.5.2.0 does not support Bootstrap installation.

### Validate installation {#validate-installation}

1. The Product Information page (*/system/console/  productinfo *) should now show the updated version string `Adobe Experience Manager, Version 6.5.2.0` under Installed Products.

1. All  OSGi  bundles are either ACTIVE or FRAGMENT in the OSGi Console (Use Web Console: /system/console/bundles).
1. The OSGI bundle org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core is on version 1.10.3 or higher (Use Web Console: /system/console/bundles).

In order to see what platforms are certified to run with this release, please refer to the [Technical Requirements](../sites/deploying/using/technical-requirements.md).

### Install AEM forms add-on package {#install-aem-forms-add-on-package}

#### Install AEM forms add-on {##installaemformsaddon}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Skip if you are not using AEM Forms. Fixes in AEM Forms are delivered through a separate add-on package.

>[!NOTE]
>
>AEM 6.5.2.0 includes a new version of [AEM Forms compatibility package](https://www.adobeaemcloud.com/content/packageshare/tools/login.html?resource=%2Fcontent%2Fmarketplace%2FmarketplaceProxy.html%3FpackagePath%3D%2Fcontent%2Fcompanies%2Fpublic%2Fadobe%2Fpackages%2Fcq650%2Ffd%2FAEM-FORMS-6.5-COMPAT&$$login$$=%24%24login%24%24). If you are using an older version of AEM Forms Compatibility Package and updating to AEM 6.5.2.0, install the latest version of AEM Forms compatibility package post installation of Forms Add-On Package.

1. Ensure that you have installed the AEM Service Pack. 
1. Download the corresponding forms add-on package listed at [AEM Forms releases](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/kb/aem-forms-releases.html) for your operating system.
1. Install the forms add-on package as described in [Installing AEM forms add-on packages](../forms/using/installing-configuring-aem-forms-osgi.md#install-aem-forms-add-on-package).

### Install AEM Forms JEE installer {#install-aem-forms-jee-installer}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Skip if you are not using AEM Forms on JEE. Fixes in AEM Forms JEE are delivered through a separate installer.

For information about installing the cumulative installer for AEM Forms JEE and post-deployment configuration, see the [release notes for patch 0004](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/quick-fixes/6-5/jee-patch-0004.html).

## Removed/Deprecated Features {#removed-deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with AEM 6.5.2. Generally, features that are planned to be removed in a future release are set to deprecated first, with an alternative provided.

Customers are advised to review if they make use of the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.

| Area |Feature |Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| Integrations |The “AEM Cloud Services Opt-In” screen has been deprecated. With the AEM/Target integration updated in AEM 6.5 to support the Target Standard API, which uses authentication via Adobe IMS and I/O, and the growing role of Adobe Launch for instrumenting AEM pages for analytics and personalization, the Opt-In wizard has become functionally irrelevant.  |Configure system connections, Adobe IMS authentication, and Adobe I/O integrations via respective AEM cloud services  |

## Known Issues {#known-issues}

The following errors and warning may occur during installation of AEM 6.5.x.x and can be safely ignored:

* “When the Target integration is configured in AEM using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type “Experience Fragment”/source “Adobe Experience Manager,” Target creates several offers with type “HTML”/source “Adobe Target Classic.” 
* com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler: No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
* Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions like SUM, MAX, MIN, etc. are used. CQ-4274424
